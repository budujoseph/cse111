CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program? Geometric Shapes Calculator

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve? 
The Geometeric Shapes Calculator program addresses the real-world need for quick and accurate calculations of 
areas, perimeter, volumes and surface areas of common geometric shapes, which is crucial in fields such as 
construction, engineering, product design and education. The program enhances efficiency, accuracy and productivity
in various professional and educational settings.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
From this program i will learn how to defined functions with parameters, and use it to perform specific task.
The project will improve my problem-solving skills,teach me hw to organize and document code effectively.
It will also help me learn implementation and control flow with loops and conditionals. 

4. What Python modules will your program use?
    * math
    * pytest

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

5. List the names of functions you will need?

    circle_area(radius)
    circle_circumference(radius)
    rectangle_area(length, width)
    rectangle_parameter(length, width)
    sphere_volume(radius)
    sphere_surface_area(radius)
    cylinder_volume(radius, height)
    cylinder_surface_area(radius, height)

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result.
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and do
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions
    to have parameters and return a result.)

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
    test_circle_area()
    test_circle_circumference()
    test_rectangle_area()
    test_rectangle_parameter()
    test_sphere_volume()
    test_sphere_surface_area()
    test_cylinder_volume()
    test_cylinder_surface_area()
